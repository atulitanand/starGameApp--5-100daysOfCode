This is my star game app

Don't focus on game logic, focus on UI logic.
* How to initialize states.
* How we initialize side effects.
* How we clean up side effects.
* How we define custom hooks to group every things that's about managing the state and transactions on the state and leave our components to just use these elements.
* useState -> compute state -> give UI.
* How we use key attribute in play again button.
* unmonting and remounting <Game /> component.
